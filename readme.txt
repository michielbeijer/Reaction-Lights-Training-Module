Hello to you ,


Thanks for taking interest in this project.
Use case of this project is to help people that want to improve their agility and reaction time.
There are lots of exercises that can be done with this and future improvements are going to be added.
If you have an ideea that i could use or you use it when you make this project i will be glad to hear it(see it).

Parts of the build:
1. 9v battery - can be replaced of course with other types of battery 
2. DC to DC converter - i use a LM2596 that i set to an output voltage of 3.6V
3. WS2812B LEDs - i have used 4 in my build (power consumption around 200mA).You could use more or even normal LEDS (of course modify the code accordingly) 
			  you just need a visual cue.
4. Flying Fish Sensor - used to detect movement (you could use other sensor this is need a little tweeking but does the job ok).
5. 220 Ohm Resistor - to be used on the data line for WS2812B
6. 3 ESP8266 - you could extended this to 10 (my understanding is that ESPNOW protocol support up to 10 devices).
7. PCB board , wires and i would use also a female header pins for ESP8266(so you can just plug them into the board and then reuse them for something else if nedded)
